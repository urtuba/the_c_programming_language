# The C Programming Languge Examples
<i>book by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie</i>
<hr>
I am reading the legendary book The C Programming Language, which is referred as "C Bible". Book constists of examples. And I will be coding them while reading and sharing them here chapter by chapter. Codes can be different a little bit because of my visual preferences or sense of humor; but I will code examples 99% as they are.

## CHAPTER 1

### 01. Hello, world!
The program that prints hello, world!

### 02. Fahrenheit - Celcius Table
The fahrenheit to celcius conversion table.

### 03. Fahrenheit - Celcius Table v2
Same fahr-celc conversion table, but more precise. It uses float instead of integers. It has some visual allignment also)
