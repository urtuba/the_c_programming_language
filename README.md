# The C Programming Languge Examples
<i>book by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie</i>
<hr>
I am reading the legendary book The C Programming Language, which is referred as "C Bible". Book constists of examples. And I will be coding them while reading and sharing them here chapter by chapter. Codes can be different a little bit because of my visual preferences or sense of humor; but I will code examples 99% as they are.

## CHAPTER 1

### 01. Hello, world!
The program that prints hello, world!

### 02. Fahrenheit - Celcius Table
The fahrenheit to celcius conversion table.

### 03. Fahrenheit - Celcius Table v2
Same fahr-celc conversion table, but more precise. It uses float instead of integers. It has some visual allignment also)

### 04. Fahrenheit - Celcius Table v3
Fahrenheit to celcius table, but it is done with for loop instead of while loop. It also starts from upper value instead of lower, long story short: Decremental for loop is used.

### 05. Copy The Text
Simple program to practice <em>getchar()</em> and <em>putchar()</em> which are character input and output functions. It takes a string and prompts the same.

### 06. Character Counter
Counts number of characters in a given input text. Type your text and send EOF signal. (Control+D for Linux)

### 07. Line Counter
Counts numbers of tab characters, new lines and spaces in a given text.

### 08. Word Counter
Simple word counter that terminates with EOF character. It uses <strong>if - else</strong> structure.

### 09. Digit Counter
Uses array to hold the count of digits.

### 10. Power Function
Calculates powers of 2 using power function defined in it.

### 11. Longest Line
Holds longest inserted line and prints it out. Void function and arrays are used.

### 12. Reverser
It reverses each line input.
